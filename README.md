# Setup

## Install
Install `@deep-foundation/chatgpt-azure` package by using [`npm-packager`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deep-foundation/npm-packager)

## Give permissions
- Insert a `Join` link from the `@deep-foundation/chatgpt-azure` package to the admin to share admin permissions with the package
<!-- TODO: Write another instruction how to give permissions when more flexible permissions will appear -->
You can do it by using the following code by executing it right in the browser console in [DeepCase](https://github.com/deep-foundation/deepcase-app)
```javascript
const joinTypeLinkId = await deep.id("@deep-foundation/core", "Join");
const chatGPTAzureLinkId = await deep.id("@deep-foundation/chatgpt-azure", "Join");
await deep.insert([
  {
    type_id: joinTypeLinkId,
    from_id: chatGPTAzureLinkId,
    to_id: await deep.id('deep', 'admin'),
  },
]);
```

## Configure

### By using client handler (recommended for new users or non-developers) 

- Query `Manager` link by using `Query` in [`DeepCase`](https://github.com/deep-foundation/deepcase-app)
- Click on `Manager` link to open its client handler and use the form to configure the package by providing api key, model name and other required information

### Manually (recommended for developers)

#### API Key
- Create an `ApiKey` link and set its value to your ChatGPT Azure API key

#### Model
- Create an `UsesModel` link from the `@deep-foundation/chatgpt-azure` package to the desired model.

- Insert a `Message` link, set its value to the message you want to send to ChatGPT
- Insert a `Reply` link from your message to the last `Message` link from ChatGPT

#### By Using Code (recommended for developers)
```ts
  const lastMessageId = 123;
  const messageTypeLinkId = await deep.id("@deep-foundation/chatgpt-azure", "Message");
  const {data: [{id: newMessageLinkId}]} = await deep.insert({
    type_id: messageTypeLinkId,
    string: {
      data:{
        value: "Your message"
      }
    },
    in: {
      type_id: containTypeLinkId,
      from_id: deep.linkId
    }
  });
  await deep.insert({
    type_id: await deep.id("@deep-foundation/messaging", "Reply"),
    from_id: newMessageLinkId,
    to_id: lastMessageId,
    in: {
      type_id: containTypeLinkId,
      from_id: deep.linkId
    }
  });
```
